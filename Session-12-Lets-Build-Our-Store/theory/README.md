Q1. useContext vs redux

Ans-1: 

⚡ useContext:- useContext is a React Hook that allows you to access the context of a parent component without prop drilling. Context is a mechanism for sharing state between components without explicitly passing props down the component tree.

👍 Advantages of useContext:- 

(1) Simplicity: useContext is built into React, so you don't need to add any external libraries to use it.
(2) Lightweight: For small to medium-sized applications, useContext can be sufficient and avoids the overhead of additional libraries like Redux.
(3) Great for local state: If you have state that only needs to be shared between a few closely related components, useContext can be a cleaner solution than Redux.

👎 Disadvantages of useContext:-

(1) Limited to React: useContext is specific to React, so if you decide to use a different framework or library, you'll need to find an alternative state management solution.
(2) Performance: useContext can be less performant than Redux for large-scale applications because it doesn't provide the same optimizations, like memoization and selective updates.

⚡ Redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store where all application state is managed, and components can dispatch actions to modify the state.

👍 Advantages of Redux:- 

(1) Predictable state management: Redux enforces a strict unidirectional data flow, making it easier to reason about your application's state changes.
(2) Scalability: Redux is well-suited for large and complex applications where state management can become challenging with just useContext.
(3) Devtools: Redux comes with powerful developer tools that make it easier to debug and inspect your application's state changes.
(4) Middleware: Redux allows you to add middleware for things like logging, routing, and asynchronous actions.Middleware: Redux allows you to add middleware for things like logging, routing, and asynchronous actions.

👎 Disadvantages of useContext:-

(1) Boilerplate: Redux often requires writing more code compared to useContext, which can increase development time.
(2) Learning curve: Redux has a learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its strict patterns and terminologies.
(3) Overhead: For small to medium-sized applications, Redux might introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead.


Q2. Advantages of the Redux tool kit over redux?

Ans-2:

🔌 Reduced Boilerplate:
🔌 Immutability Built-In
🔌 Automated Action Creation
🔌 Normalized State Management
🔌 Built-In DevTools Integration
🔌 Thunk Middleware Simplification
🔌 Selective Imports
🔌 Better Default Configuration
🔌 Backward Compatibility

Q3. Explain Dispatcher

Ans-3: 

In a software application, a "dispatcher" is like a traffic cop that helps manage and direct tasks or actions to the right places.

Imagine you have a busy intersection with different types of vehicles (cars, buses, bikes) all trying to go in different directions. The dispatcher is the person who controls the traffic signals, making sure each vehicle knows when to stop, go, or turn. They ensure that the traffic flows smoothly and safely.

In a computer program, a "dispatcher" does something similar. It's a part of the program that takes requests or tasks and sends them to the appropriate parts of the program to be handled. Just like the traffic dispatcher, it ensures that everything runs smoothly and efficiently by directing tasks to where they need to go.

So, in simple terms, a dispatcher in software helps coordinate and manage tasks or actions within a program, making sure they go to the right places and are handled properly.

Q4. Explain Reducer
Ans-4: 

Reducer is a function that determines how an application's state should change in response to various actions.

Imagine you have a box (representing your application's state), and you want to change what's inside that box based on certain instructions (actions). A reducer is like a rulebook that tells you how to make those changes.

🚀 key components of a reducer:- 

🥇 Current State: This is the current contents of the box, representing your application's state.

🥇 Action: These are the instructions that tell you what change needs to be made. Actions typically have a type (a description of the action) and sometimes carry additional data.

🥇 Reducer Function: This is a JavaScript function that takes two arguments: the current state and an action. It examines the action type and, based on that, specifies how the state should change. It returns the new state after applying the changes.


Q5. Explain slice 

Ans-5:

slice is used to organize and manage a portion of your application's state, including its associated actions and reducers. It's a way to modularize and simplify your Redux code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

🚀 SuperPower using slice:

🔌 Modularity
🔌 Readability
🔌 Reusability
🔌 Reduced Boilerplate


Q6. Explain selector

Ans-6: 

selector is a function that allows you to extract specific pieces of data from the global state managed by Redux. Selectors are particularly useful for retrieving and computing derived data from the state in a more organized and efficient manner.

Q7. Explain createSlice

Ans-7: 

createSlice is a function provided by Redux Toolkit that simplifies the process of creating Redux slices. A Redux slice is like a small part of the overall application state with its own reducer functions and action creators. createSlice combines these parts into a single package, reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.

  In a simple way, let's break down the configuration options createSlice takes:

  {1} Name
  {2} Initial State
  {3} Reducers

Q8. what is Redux store?

Ans-8: Redux store is a kind of a very big JavaScript object with a lot of data inside it and it has kept in a global central place.
