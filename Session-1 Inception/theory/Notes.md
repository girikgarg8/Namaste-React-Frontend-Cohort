Root is the place where we want to inject the React code.

Generally, in any project, there is only one root element.

React can be used in some specific portions of the code too, like the rest of the code could be in HTML/CSS/JS (like Header and Footer), and we could just inject the React code in the search bar container.

JSX was introduced because writing lots of React.createElement is tedious for programmers and makes the code tedious.

But, many developers think that writing JSX is the only way to write React, this is incorrect, because in fact, React.createElement API exists which can be used to create React elements.
